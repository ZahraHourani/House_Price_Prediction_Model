# House_Price_Prediction_Model
The King County House Prices Prediction project focuses on developing an accurate
model for estimating house prices in King County, Washington. The project
recognizes the significant impact of house features on property valuation. By
analyzing a comprehensive dataset of property attributes, including location, size,
number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant factors, the project aims to
identify the key features that influence house prices. Through the application of
advanced machine learning techniques and predictive modeling algorithms, the
project seeks to establish relationships between these features and the corresponding
price outcomes. This analysis will provide valuable insights into how specific house
features contribute to variations in property values, ultimately assisting
homeowners, real estate professionals, and potential buyers in understanding the
pricing dynamics of the local housing market.
