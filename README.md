# House_Price_Prediction_Model
The King County House Prices Predictive Model project aims to develop an accurate and
reliable model for predicting the sale prices of houses in King County, Washington. The
project utilizes a comprehensive dataset that encompasses various attributes of residential
properties, including location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other pertinent
features.
The primary objective of this project is to assist homeowners, real estate agents, and potential
buyers in the King County area by providing an effective tool for estimating house prices. By
leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and predictive modeling algorithms, the
developed model offers valuable insights into the factors that influence house prices within
this particular region.
The project follows a systematic approach, encompassing data preprocessing, feature
engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. Several regression algorithms, such as
linear regression, support vector regression, or gradient boosting, are explored and compared
to identify the most accurate and robust model for the King County housing market.
Evaluation of predictive models was performed using appropriate metrics, such as mean
absolute error or R-squared, to assess the models' performance and generalization capabilities.
In addition, a feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the key factors affecting
home prices in the area.
The anticipated outcome is a predictive model that offers accurate estimates of house prices,
enabling informed decision-making in the King County housing market.
